Stack PRFs with Common Conversion points (CCP) method
-------------------------------------------------------

This note will introduce how to stack PRFs with CCP method in two steps.

**1. Convert PRFs from time axis to depth axis according to 1D velocity model.**

**2. Search and stack amplitudes in each bin with calculated pierce points falling in.**

Preparation
=================

Before the CCP stacking, we should prepare:

PRFs data with sac format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The SACHeader of ``b``, ``delta`` and ``npts`` are required. The ``b`` denote the shift time before P arrival.
- All of SAC files belong to a same station must be put into a same **directory with name of the station name.**
- A list file with 10 columns is required in this directory, whose format as:
    - ``evt``: the datetime part of sacfile name of each PRF.
    - ``phase``: The phase part of sacfile name of each PRF.
    - ``evlat``: The latitude of the event.
    - ``evlon``: The longitude of the event.
    - ``evdep``: The focal depth of the event.
    - ``dis``: The epicentral distance between event and station.
    - ``bazi``: The back-azimuth from event to station.
    - ``rayp``: The ray parameter of the event.
    - ``mag``: The magnitude of the event.
    - ``f0``: The gauss factor used in computing the PRF.

A station list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A text table of station information with 3 columns:

- ``station``: The station name which should be the same as the directory name including PRF Files.
- ``stlat``: The latitude of the station.
- ``stlon``: The longitude of the station.

A parameter file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter file include parameters used in the time-to-depth and CCP stacking. the format should follow ``configparser`` module. See :doc:`/notes/ccp_cfg`


(Optional) A lib of Ps ray parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would stack PRFs in a large depth (e.g., D410 or D660), the ray parameters of P arrival cannot represent that of Ps phase. Therefore, a library file of Ps ray parameters in different depths and epicentral distance is required in calculating Ps-P time difference. This lib file is in ``.npy`` format, which can be read with ``numpy.load``. You can generate it by command of gen_rayp_lib:

::

  usage: gen_rayp_lib [-h] -d min_dis/max_dis/interval -e min_dep/max_dep/interval [-l min_layer/man_layer] [-o outpath]

  Gen a ray parameter lib for Pds phases

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -d min_dis/max_dis/interval
                          Distance range in degree
    -e min_dep/max_dep/interval
                          Event depth range in km
    -l min_layer/man_layer
                          layers range as in km, defaults to 0/800
    -o outpath            Out path to Pds ray parameter lib


Here, we provide a ray-parameter file with distance from 30-90 degree and source depth from 0 to 600 km: `psrayp.npz <https://osf.io/utx24/download>`__

(Optional) Time difference correction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3D velocity model
++++++++++++++++++

To correct influence by velocity anomalies above the interface you wanna study, you can use a 3D velocity model to correct Ps-P time difference. The model file should be ``.npz`` format (generated by `numpy.savez <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html?highlight=savez>`__) with 5 fields:

- ``dep``: Depth axis. 1D ``numpy.array`` with shape of ``(len_dep,)``
- ``lat``: Latitude axis. 1D ``numpy.array`` with shape of ``(len_lat,)``
- ``lon``: Longitude axis. 1D ``numpy.array`` with shape of ``(len_lon,)``
- ``vp``: P wave velocity. 3D ``numpy.array`` with shape of ``(len_dep, len_lat, len_lon)``
- ``vs``: S wave velocity. 3D ``numpy.array`` with shape of ``(len_dep, len_lat, len_lon)``

We also provide a command to grid velocity structure from a text file.

::

  usage: veltxt2mod [-h] -r lonmin/lonmax/latmin/latmax/val [-c ncol_lat/ncol_lon/ncol_dep/ncol_vp[/ncol_vs]] [-d depmin/depmax/val] [-m linear|nearest|cubic] [-o O] velfile

  Convert velocity model with text format to npz format for 3-D moveout correction

  positional arguments:
    velfile               velocity file in text format

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -r lonmin/lonmax/latmin/latmax/val
                          Range of the grid region with interval in degree
    -c ncol_lat/ncol_lon/ncol_dep/ncol_vp[/ncol_vs]
                          Which columns to read, with 0 being the first, order by lat/lon/dep/vp/vs. If 4 columns were received,the fourth column represents Vp, and the Vs will be
                          calculated as a relationship betweenthe Vp/Vs and the depth in Cammarano et al., (2003), defaults to 0/1/2/3/4
    -d depmin/depmax/val  Range of the grid region with interval in km, defaults to 0/850/50
    -m linear|nearest|cubic
                          Method of interpolation. One of 'linear', 'nearest', 'cubic', defaults to 'linear'
    -o O                  output filename with 'npz' format, defaults to ./mod3d.npz

1D velocity models of stations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes 1D velocity model of each station is inverted by receiver functions or joint with surface wave dispersion. Seispy involves a time difference correction using 1D velocity model of each station. We need to create a folder including velocity models of stations as 

::

  vel_model/
    ├── YN001.vel
    ├── YN002.vel
    ├── YN003.vel
    ├── ......

.. note::

  - The number of files in vel_model must be the same as the number of stations in the station list.
  - The model file should have three columns: depth, Vp and Vs.
  - The filename must be the same as the station name in the station list. The suffix of filename must be ``.vel``.

Time-to-depth conversion
==============================

``rf2depth`` command would convert PRFs from time axis to depth axis using above preparations:

::

  usage: rf2depth [-h] [-d 3d_velmodel_path] [-m 1d_velmodel_folder] [-r 3d_velmodel_path] cfg_file

  Convert Ps RF to depth axis

  positional arguments:
    cfg_file              Path to configure file

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -d 3d_velmodel_path   Path to 3d vel model in npz file for time difference correction
    -m 1d_velmodel_folder
                          Folder path to 1d vel model files with staname.vel as the file name
    -r 3d_velmodel_path   Path to 3d vel model in npz file for 3D ray tracing


- ``-r`` for time difference correction with 3D velocity model.
- ``-m`` for time difference correction with 1D velocity models.


The output structure would be saved as a ``.npy`` file, which can be read with ``numpy.load``. The number of items is equal to the number of stations in **Station list**. Each item has 9 fields:

- ``Station``: The station name.
- ``stalat``: The Latitude of the station.
- ``stalon``: The Longitude of the station.
- ``bazi``: The back-azimuth of each event (1D array with shape of ``(ev_num,)``).
- ``rayp``: The Ray-parameter of each event (1D array with shape of ``(ev_num,)``).
- ``moveout_correct``: The amplitude for each PRF after time-depth conversion (2D array with shape of ``(ev_num, layer_num)``).
- ``Piercelat``: Latitudes of each event at each depth (2D array with shape of ``(ev_num, layer_num)``).
- ``Piercelon``: Longitudes of each event at each depth (2D array with shape of ``(ev_num, layer_num)``).
- ``StopIndex``: The last layer after time-depth conversion (2D array with shape of ``(ev_num, layer_num)``).

.. note::
  
  The layer_num was determined by field ``[depth]`` in parameter file.

CCP Stack PRFs along a profile
================================

The ``ccp_profile`` command provide functions to stack PRFs along a profile:

::

  usage: ccp_profile [-h] [-t] cfg_file

  Stack PRFS along a profile

  positional arguments:
    cfg_file    Path to CCP configure file

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    -t          Output as a text file


Parameters for stacking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``cfg_file`` involves parameters for stacking. We provide 3 methods to set up location of profile and bins in the stacking. In addition, 2 shapes of bins and uniform or various radius of bins can be set.

Shape of bins
******************

- ``shape``

  - ``rect``: Rectangle bin perpendicular to a linear profile, conversion points are projected to the profile in stacking.
  - ``circ``: Circle bin, distance between conversion points and center points are calculated.

- ``bin_radius``: Radius of bins. Set to empty for determination with the fresnel zone radius. Such situation, the period of can be set in ``domperiod``.
- ``slide_val``: Interval between adjacent bins in km.

Set up profile and stations
******************************

- **Using stations from an seismic array**: In this scheme, ``stalist`` include all stations of the array, but only a few stations are need for CCP stacking. We can set up ``[line]`` section and ``width`` in km to collect stations in a rectangle region. The stations will write into ``stack_sta_list``

  .. figure:: ../_static/t1.png
    :width: 50.0%
    :align: center
    
    Stations collected from a seismic array. White iverted triangles denote stations in ``stalist``. Red triangles denote station used for CCP stacking. Blue line denote location of profile.

- **Using specified stations**: If the ``stack_sta_list`` is set to a existing file, stations in this file are used for CCP stacking. The start and end point of the profile are set in ``[line]`` section.

- **Using stations as a linear array with self-adaptive bins**: If the CCP stacking is preformed on a curved linear array, a self-adaptive setting of bins maybe suitable. In this case, once ``adaptive`` is set to ``true``, ``slide_val`` and ``stack_sta_list``  is specified, bins are created along the station curve. 

  .. note:: 

    - The ``[line]`` section and ``rect`` bins are invalid in such situation.
    - Stations in the ``stack_sta_list`` should be in order along the linear array
