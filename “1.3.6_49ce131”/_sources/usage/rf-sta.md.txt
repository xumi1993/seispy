# Calculate PRFs for single station

## Prepare seismic records order by stations

Seismic data including direct P arrival should be trimmed according earthquakes. Meanwhile, the data should be order by stations instead of events. For example, YN001 and YN002 are stations; the SAC files are teleseismic data records of these stations.

## Calculate PRFs using a simple command

### Prepare a configure file

We should prepare a configure file as following including all parameters that will be set during the calculation. The format is following Python module of [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html). We have provided a template configure file in {any}`../notes/rf_cfg`. See comment in detail.

## Run in command line

We have provided the command `prf`. The usage is shown as:

```
usage: prf [-h] [-l] [-r N|E|NE] [-s] [-b [BAZ]] [-w] [-f finallist] cfg_file

  Calculating RFs for single station

  positional arguments:
    cfg_file      Path to RF configure file

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help    show this help message and exit
    -l            use local catalog, defaults to false
    -r N|E|NE     Reverse components: N, E or NE
    -s            Switch the East and North components
    -b [BAZ]      Correct back-azimuth. If "baz" is specified, the corr_baz = raw_baz + baz. If there is no argument, the back-azimuth will be corrected with minimal energy
                  of T component. The searching range is raw_baz +/- 90
    -w            Write project to localfile
    -f finallist  Specify finallist for re-calculating RFs and -l is invalid in this pattern
```


- `cfg_file`: configure file.
- `-l` if the argument was specified, a local file of catalog would be used in searching earthquakes.
- `-r` Reverse the horizontal components. The arguments should be in `EN`, `E` or `N`.
- `-s` If this option is specified, the East and North components would be changed.
- `-b` Correct back-azimuth. If {math}`baz` is specified, the {math}`baz_{corr} = baz_{raw} + baz`. If no arguments following `-b`,  back-azimuth will be corrected for grid searching minimal energy of T component. The searching range is {math}`baz_{raw} \pm 90^{\circ}`
- `-f` Add a path to final-list following this option. Event information in the final-list is used instead of searching earthquakes from catalog.

## Initialize a project instance


**To further understand the procedure of the command**  `prf` **, we recommend calculating PRFs with writing a Python script as following steps.**

First, let's initialize a `RF`instance. In this instance, we can set parameters and calculate PRFs using functions of the class.


```python
from seispy.rf import RF
from os.path import join
from obspy import UTCDateTime

pjt = RF()
```

## Set parameters

Most of parameters are saved in the class `pjt.para`. All default parameters are shown as following

```python
print(pjt.para.__dict__)
```

```
{'_datapath': '/Users/xumj',
'_rfpath': '/Users/xumj',
'_imagepath': '/Users/xumj',
'_catalogpath': '/Users/xumj/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-5.3.1/lib/python3.7/site-packages/seispy-1.1.8-py3.7.egg/seispy/data/EventCMT.dat',
'offset': None,
'tolerance': 210,
'dateformat': '%Y.%j.%H.%M.%S',
'date_begin': 1976-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z,
'date_end': 2019-07-11T14:04:15.365860Z,
'magmin': 5.5,
'magmax': 10,
'dismin': 30,
'dismax': 90,
'ref_comp': 'BHZ',
'suffix': 'SAC',
'noisegate': 5,
'gauss': 2,
'target_dt': 0.01,
'phase': 'P',
'time_before': 10,
'time_after': 120,
'only_r': False}
```

Thus, we can set them in our scripts

```python
pjt.para.datapath = 'Data/Path/to/station_name'
pjt.para.rfpath = 'Result/Path/to/station_name'
pjt.para.suffix = 'sac'
pjt.para.ref_comp = ".1."
pjt.date_begin = UTCDateTime('20180701')
pjt.date_end = UTCDateTime('20190701')
pjt.para.offset = 0
pjt.para.tolerance = 60
```


or in a configure file as above. When you want to initialize an instance using this configure file, please add the path to `RF()` as:

```python
pjt = RF(cfg_file='path/to/config')
```

## Search earthquakes from catalog

We use the same procedure as the [SplitRFLab](https://git.nju.edu.cn/xumi1993/SplitRFLab). To match the data records and events, we should search earthquakes with some criteria (period, epicentral distance and magnitude).

### Load station information

the The station latitude and longitude are absolutely necessary when we are used to search earthquakes. the function will read `stla` and `stlo` of SAC header from files in `pjt.para.datapath`.

```python
pjt.load_stainfo()
```

## Search earthquakes


the function provide two method to search earthquakes. use

```python
pjt.search_eq()
```

to search earthquakes in IRIS Web service with the CMT catalog.

In addition, the function allow to prepare earthquakes from a CMT catalog file (defaults to `seispy/seispy/data/EventCMT.dat`). Use command `updatecatalog` to update this default catalog file.

```python
pjt.search_eq(local=True)
```

## Associate SAC files with events


This is a important step, which allow to link SAC files and earthquakes in catalog. The `pjt.para.dateformat`, that is a format string as in [time.strftime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime), including `datetime` information will allow to match events in catalog. For example, assuming the filename is `2018.229.15.35.02.1.sac`. the `pjt.para.dateformat` should be `%Y.%j.%H.%M.%S`.

A reference sac file will read to Associate with events. Thus, file-search-string will help to find real SAC files in data path. In this program file-search-string composed of `pjt.para.ref_comp` and `pjt.para.suffix`. The presence of `*pjt.para.ref_comp*pjt.para.suffix`, such as `*.1.*sac` in this example, for SAC files will be found.

the `pjt.para.offset` and `pjt.para.tolerance` are used to match the origin time from catalog. The definition are the same as those in [SplitRFLab](https://git.nju.edu.cn/xumi1993/SplitRFLab).

```{note}
- The `offset` is the time duration between the event time and the starting time of your seismograms. Ideally, this offset should be identical to the “request start time” defined in the previous window but the data management center may have sent you data beginning later than requested. The offset value represents this difference.

- The `Tolerance` value in seconds will define the time window within which the program will try to associate a seismic file to an event file, by using either its name or the information contained in the header. It is up to the user to find the best compromise: a value too small will let orphans and a value too large will bring confusion since several files could be associated to a seismic event.
```

```{figure} ../_static/offset.png
  :alt: offset
  :align: center

After setting up these parameters, use following command to associate data records to the catalog:
```

```python
pjt.match_eq()
```

## Pre-processing

The process of pretreatment include detrend, bandpass filter, calculating arrival time, reject bad record with low SNR, trim records and rotate components from NE to RT.

### Filter


We will apply a bandpass filter on seismic records. Two corners should be specified.

- `para.freqmin`: Pass band low corner frequency.
- `para.freqmax`: Pass band high corner frequency.

### Signal-noise-ratios (SNR) calculation

seismic records with poor quality will be rejected in this step. We will reject records with SNR < `para.noisegate`. The SNR was calculated as:

```{math}  
  SNR = 10log_{10}\left(\frac{A_S}{A_N}\right)
```
where {math}`A_N` and {math}`A_N` are root mean squares (RMS) of the waveform trimmed with time length of `para.noiselen` before and after theoretical P arrival times, respectively.

### Trim


The waveforms will be cut in this step before `para.time_before` and after `para.time_after` theoretical P arrival times, respectively.

```python
pjt.detrend()
pjt.filter() # default using 'para.freqmin' and 'para.freqmax'
pjt.cal_phase()
pjt.drop_eq_snr() # The threshold used as 'para.noisegate'
pjt.trim() # from 'para.time_before' before P to 'para.time_after' after P
pjt.rotate()
```

## Saving and loading this project

### Save this project

The class `RF` provided method to save the parameters and associated seismic events. 

```python
pjt.save('path/to/pjt.pkl')
```

A `pkl` file will be saved into local path, which include the subclass `pjt.para` and `pjt.eqs`. The `pjt.eqs` is a `DataFrame` instance with following columns

:::{list-table} Saved columns of the `pjt.eqs`
:align: center
:header-rows: 1
* - Column
  - Implication
* - `date`
  - Origin time of the event
* - `evla`
  - Latitude of the event
* - `evlo` 
  - Longitude of the event
* - `evdp`
  - Focal depth of the event
* - `mag`
  - Magnitude of the event 
* - `bazi`
  - Back-azimuth between the station and the event
* - `dis`
  - Great arc distance between the station and the event
* - `datestr`
  - Datetime field in the associated SAC filename
:::

### Load this project

Create a new project and load the save project file for RF recalculation. 

```python
newpjt = RF()
newpjt.load('path/to/pjt.pkl')
```

```{note}
- The waveform data will not be saved into file. So please ensure that the data files are exists in the `newpjt.para.datapath`.
- The data files will be reload via `newpjt.load('path/to/pjt.pkl')`. Thus the pretreatment is necessary in recalculation.
```

## PRFs calculation

We need parameters of `pjt.para.gauss`, `pjt.para.itmax` and `pjt.para.minderr` to calculate PRFs using iterative time-domain deconvolution method

- `pjt.para.gauss`: Gauss factor. Default is 2.0.
- `pjt.para.itmax`: The maximum number of iterations. Default is 400.
- `pjt.para.minderr`: The minimum misfit. Default is 0.001.

```python
pjt.deconv()
```

## Save PRFs

Save the PRFs to `pjt.para.rfpath` with some criteria. Two kind of criteria allow to set (i.e., `crust` or `mtz`). if the parameter set as None, all of PRFs will be saved.

- `crust`
  - The maximum peak should appear between -2s and 2s.

- `mtz`
  - The maximum peak should appear between -5s and 5s.
  - the maximum amplitudes of PRFs in a 30–120 s window after the direct P are smaller than 30% of the maximum amplitudes of the direct P phases.

```python
pjt.saverf(criterion='crust')
```
